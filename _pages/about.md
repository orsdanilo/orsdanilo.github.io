I currently work as a researcher in speech signal processing. I like to study about machine learning, signal processing computational linguistics. 

I'm very interested in language, both visual and spoken. It's one of the most extraordinary things humans can do, though it seems so natural.

I also enjoy learning about arts: cinema, storytellng, music, graphic novels, illustration, etc. I like to draw stuff every once in a while, check out the [gallery page]({% link _pages/gallery.md %})!

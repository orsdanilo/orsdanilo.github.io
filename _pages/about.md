I currently work as a Data Scientist at IBM Brazil. I like to study about machine learning and computational linguistics. 

I'm very interested in language, both visual and spoken. It's one of the most extraordinary things humans can do, though it seems so natural.

I also enjoy learning about arts: cinema, storytellng, music, graphic novels, illustration, it all amazes me!
